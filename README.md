# Meet Up

Meet Up is meant to help users coordinate and plan availabilities to schedule the best time to set an event.

## Motivation and Goals

Main goal of this project is to further develop full-stack development skills

## Features

- Ability to create events with a name, start datetime, end datetime, and timezone.
- Creating new user for events
- Setting availability times for users

## Technology Stack

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- MySQL

## Usage

### Backend

1. Set up MySQL locally by creating a new database called `meet_up`
2. Use `/backend/tables.sql` to source the tables
3. Use ``` node index.js ``` in backend folder to run the backend

## Project Experience

### Challenges

1. Starting development of backend API without any previous work experiences or knowledge about backend development.

### Mistakes

1. Constant refactoring backend API after learning proper SOLID technique for API development (Controllers and Services functionality)

### Enjoyed

1. Learning the thought process of how to properly develop a backend API and connecting to a database to handle data.

### What I would do differently

1. Research more information about backend develop at the beginning rather than throughout the project in order to save time on refactoring.
