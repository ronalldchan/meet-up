# Meet Up

Meet Up is a scheduling application designed to help users coordinate and plan availabilities to find the best time to set up an event. Whether for social gatherings, meetings, or collaborative events, Meet Up simplifies the process of finding a time that works for everyone.

## üéØ Motivation and Goals

The primary motivation behind the Meet Up project is to further develop and strengthen full-stack development skills by building a fully functional web application from scratch. Key goals for the project include:

- Frontend Development: Create a dynamic, interactive user interface with React and Material UI, focusing on responsive design and user experience optimization.
- Backend Development: Gain deeper experience with server-side logic, API design, and database interactions using TypeScript and MySQL.
- Project Architecture: Design scalable and maintainable software architecture for efficient and effective development.
- Feature Expansion: Continuously explore and implement new features to enhance the usability and functionality of the application.
- End-to-End Development Workflow: Gain hands-on experience in every stage of development, from initial project setup to deployment and maintenance.

## üöÄ Features

- Event Creation: Create events with a name, dates, earliest time, latest time, and timezone.
- User Management: Create new users for events.
- User Availability: Set availability times for users to help coordinate schedules efficiently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- TypeScript: Type-safe development for both frontend and backend
- React: Dynamic and interactive UI
- Material UI: Modern and responsive design system
- MySQL: Reliable and scalable database for event and user data

## Usage

### Backend

1. Set up MySQL locally by creating a new database called `meet_up`
2. Use `/backend/tables.sql` to source the tables
3. Use ``` node index.js ``` in backend folder to run the backend

## Project Experience

### Challenges

1. Starting development of backend API without any previous work experiences or knowledge about backend development.

### Mistakes

1. Constant refactoring backend API after learning proper SOLID technique for API development (Controllers and Services functionality)
2. No proper research into timezone management for event scheduling, leading to major refactoring of backend

### Enjoyed

1. Learning the thought process of how to properly develop a backend API and connecting to a database to handle data.

### What I would do differently

1. Research more information about backend develop at the beginning rather than throughout the project in order to save time on refactoring.
